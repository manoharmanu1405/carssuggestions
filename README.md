# carssuggestions
Hello folks..
This is Manohar..
I have done this project in my B.Tech 2nd year as part of my cirriculum
This project is simply based on AWT,Swing Components.
I have managed to design a GUI Application using Java as backend and AWT,Swings serving frontend.
The GUI may not be much great but just servers the purpose


The idea of the project is simply as follows:
->User first gets to homepage

->There he can login or signin else skip registration(login enables them to add reviews for the cars and also rate them)
->Soon after that they will be redirected to Main Functionality of the app

->Here they can select their required features for their cars like below:

After selecting the required features they will be displayed with all the cars with the applied filters.
      
All the cars info should the preloaded to the database
All the car images should be placed in a separate folder and the directory has to be modified accordingly in the project files which takes upto 5 min.  
Here i have used all the database configurations for mysql.So anyone who needs to run the project should install MySQL Server and create a minipj named database in           that and create database tables required for the project with appropriate schema.
The required database tables are cardata,reviews and the schema can observed by inspecting carimage.java,reviews.java files and can create accordingly


Finally, after doing all the configurations the user can be able to signup,signin,check cars with suitables specs,check and add reviews and ratings and also signed users can have special access to favourites board where they can bookmark their favourite cars.     
                                                Thanks for reading :)
